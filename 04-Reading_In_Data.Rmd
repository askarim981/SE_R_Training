# Reading in Data 

One of R's best applications is for manipulating and analysing data. However, R doesn't have a store of data (aside from some basic pre-loaded datasets). We need to save this outside the R environment and then load or read it into R. Our data tends to be stored in excel files - either workbooks or .csvs - or SQL databases. You can also read in data  from Stata and other programmes. Use Google to find packages that allow you to read in this data, if this is how your data is stored. 

This section uses 3x Higher Education-focused examples of reading in data. If you set your working directory as per the code below, you will be able to read in the data files being used. 

## Good practice

As shown below, **documentation is essential**. For example, if you download data from NOMIS and delete the 10-12 rows of table identifiers, a future analyst or QA analyst will struggle to identify the source of the data, or to verify that filters are correct. 

Equally, with any other data source, if you do not include very clear links to 

* the source,
* [if relevant] when it was accessed,
* [if relevant] where from within that source the data come,

then it is impossible to verify the source data. 

It is good practice to store this information at the top of a document; in a log of input data; or within your code. 


## Reading in .csvs and excel workbooks

You can read in data using the whole file URL or from a relative file path, using your current working directory as a root. A reminder of how to check your directory is below. Refer to section [2.2: R Projects](#Projects) for more detail. 



```{r, eval=FALSE, tidy=TRUE, tidy.opts=list(width.cutoff=80)}
getwd() 
#if your directory is not where it needs to be to load data or source a file, set it

#Alternatively, you can navigate through to the relative path, as long as the location is on the same drive.
setwd("")

```


### .csvs 

The `read.csv()` function is pre-loaded into R through the utils package. We will usually want to assign the loaded data to an object, so that we have it stored in our global environment. 

AN APS data file on csv is downloaded from NOMIS which has employment figures for 412 4-digit SOC codes. It is saved in the project's data folder. I have done nothing to the file other than save it as a UTF-8 comma delimited .csv file. The first 16 rows of the HESA data contain unique identifiers, details about the source and file specification, which can be referred back to. 


```{r eval=FALSE}
Employment_by_SOC_Mar_25 <- read.csv(file =  "Data/Occupation_employment_figures_Mar_2025_4_digit_SOC.csv") 
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics('images and graphics/APS_data.JPG')
```

**BUT** reading this in will create a data frame with lots of blank values, missing column titles and irrelevant rows.

Because the top 13 or so rows are useful for documentation and finding the data source, we want to keep these in the .csv file, but we don't want R to read them into R, so we tell the read.csv function to skip them.

```{r eval=FALSE}
Employment_by_SOC_Mar_25 <- read.csv(file = "Data/Occupation_employment_figures_Mar_2025_4_digit_SOC.csv", skip = 13)
```

If we want the column names exactly how they appear in the data, we can add the `check.names = FALSE argument`. When referencing these columns, you will need to put the name inside tilted apostrophes in order to tell R that the object has spaces in it, otherwise R will read a single column heading as many, and you will get an error.
_This is why it is common to use underscores when naming objects and variables_

```{r eval=FALSE}
Employment_by_SOC_Mar_25 <- read.csv(file = "Data/Occupation_employment_figures_Mar_2025_4_digit_SOC.csv", skip = 13, check.names = FALSE) %>% 
  rename("occupation_soc_code_label" = 1) # renaming empty column
```

Now we have a rectangular dataset with non blank values and the column names we want. But when we check the data format, we find that data has been read in as character data. We can see this with `str(Employment_by_SOC_Mar_25)`

You can change this by selecting which columns you want to be numeric. We want columns 2 and 3 to be numeric.

If you simply specify that you want them `as.numeric`, R will turn the values with commas into NAs. One way to avoid this is using readr's `parse_number` function from the `readr` package. 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# load readr
library(readr)

# create a new object with columns 3 to 27 now numeric
Numeric_Employment_by_SOC_Mar_25 <- Employment_by_SOC_Mar_25 %>%
  mutate_at(2:3, readr::parse_number) 

# check the structure of the data
str(Numeric_Employment_by_SOC_Mar_25) # we can now see that columns 2 and 3 are numeric
```


You can now explore the data as shown in segment 2.5.1 - [Data Frames]

In some cases, R might create funky column headings. Some options for solving might include

* use `fileEncoding = "UTF-8-BOM"` as an argument within the read.csv function
* check the source data


Some other examples of making data numeric or replacing NAs with 0

```{r eval=FALSE}
mutate(across(-c(`SOC Code`),  ~as.numeric(.x)))
mutate(across(-c(SOC_label), ~ readr::parse_number(.x)))
mutate(across(everything(), ~replace_na(., 0)))

# remove rows where all values are #N/A
filter_at(vars(everything()), all_vars(!is.na(.)))
```


### Large .csvs

The `fread()` function is faster than read.csv, but has less flexibility.


### Excel workbooks

It might be that you want to store lots of sheets in a single workbook, and want to read in a particular sheet. It also might be that you want to do some manipulation in excel first, then want to read in outputs that have had calculations applied. If you do this, I would advise **locking** the sheet so that no more changes can be made. Add a "READ ME.txt" file to the folder containing the password to unlock the sheets, or stick it in a sheet at the start of the workbook. Changes will affect the data when re-read into R, post-changes.

.csv files are saved as comparabily small files, with no formulas or calculations, just cell values. If you need to save these cell formulas then an excel workbook will probably be preferable. 

The `read_excel` function comes from the `readxl` package

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(readxl)

# Example
# Assuming you have a file with multiple sheets

Sector_employment_figures <- read_excel(path = "Data/Multiple Sector sheets workbook.xlsx", 
                                          sheet = "Creative Industries", 
                                          range = "A17:AA237")

```

## SQL


SQL databases are a common and secure way to store data. SQL data can be loaded into R. Equally, SQL code can be run within R studio (you can tell your script to translate the code into R code, effectively).

Data exploration of SQL is much faster and more efficient if done in the SQL programme itself. 

The applications below show how to load data from DfE SQL servers. The code will not work without access to the data.

### Connecting to databases

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(odbc)
con <- dbConnect(odbc(), Driver = "SQL Server", 
                 Server = "T1PRMDRSQL\\SQLPROD,55842", 
                 Database = "PDR",
                 Trusted_Connection = "yes")

```

### Loading data into R

```{r eval=FALSE}
# download the data
# instead of "Tier 1" this argument might be whatever is before the full stop in front of the table name when shown in SQL. For UCAS data, for example, this is "dbo"
KS4_data <- tbl(con, in_schema("Tier1", "KS4_Pupil_MasterView"))

# it is best to apply filters at this stage to improve efficiency and minimise the amount of data that R needs to extract
students <- KS4_data %>% select(URN,  PupilMatchingRefAnonymous, FSM6CLA) %>% collect()

```

### Running SQL Queries 

```{r eval=FALSE}
# run a query from the connection established (as shown above)
# put a query in quotation marks
# An example query has been left in quotation marks for clarity

output_data <- dbGetQuery(con, "
                                select distinct [Postcode], [Quintile]
                                from [HE-AN-DATA-NS].[Geography].[OfS_POLARPostcode]
                                where [Measure] = 'Polar4_quintile'
                          ")

```
